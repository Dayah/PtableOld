     <DT><STRONG>Who made this periodic table?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>Michael Dayah.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>Why?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>He thought it would look nice converted to HTML and wanted to see if he could do it. He was also bored while staying at home recovering from <A HREF="http://www.dayah.com/toes/">toe surgery</A>.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>When?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>September 1997. It was posted on the Internet October 1, 1997. Element descriptions were added later in December 1997.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>What's the big deal? There are other periodic tables on the Internet.</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>Not only is this one of the very few tables that has all the information on one page, it's quite possibly the most complex use of HTML tables anywhere on the Internet. This periodic table was made with approximately eight hundred lines of HTML, no images.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>How long did it take to make?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>A total of about five hours plus one half hour per month maintenance.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>From where was the look of the table taken?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>The color scheme is loosely based on a Frank Schaffer Publications poster. The categories were also used from this poster. The idea of using white space between elements was taken from the periodic table in the designer's biology book.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>Can I print it?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM><A HREF="Images/PeriodicTable.GIF">Yes</A>. You may wish to resize or resample the image to fit on a page using your graphics program.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>Is there a license agreement I must follow?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>Because of the frequent piracy of the periodic table, you are not allowed to redistribute the table electronically in any fashion. You, however, are allowed to print the table out for your own, personal use. If you would like to print out many copies for a classroom, please tell me.</EM></DD>
     <DD><EM>You may also obtain a high-gloss print or transparency of the periodic table. Simply send five US dollars to Michael Dayah, 2420 Congress Parkway #107, Athens, TN 37303, with your e-mail address.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>Can I link to your periodic table?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>By all means. You can distinguish it from other periodic tables by linking it as &quot;Michael Dayah's Periodic Table&quot; or &quot;LuceNT's Periodic Table&quot;.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>How can I get in touch with you?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>The easiest way to reach me is through IRC on <A HREF="http://www.efnet.net/">EFnet</A>. My nickname is LuceNT. My ICQ UIN is <A HREF="http://wwp.mirabilis.com/1186770">1186770</A> and my e-mail address is <A HREF="mailto:michael@dayah.com">michael@dayah.com</A>. You may also use the <A HREF="feedback.html">feedback form</A>.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>Where can I see other sites made by the designer of this table?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>The designer's personal web site is <A HREF="http://www.dayah.com/">www.dayah.com</A>. Links to most of his other sites can be found there.</EM></DD>

   <DT>
    <DL>

     <DT><STRONG>The table looks distorted or is indecipherable.</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>Consider upgrading your browser. Below is a description of which browsers can display which aspects of the page. The HTML 4 compliant version of the page looks a bit messy even in the 5.0 browsers because they still do not fully support CSS. If the paragraph tells you your browser is &quot;sufficient&quot;, and it still looks distorted, please <A HREF="mailto:michael@dayah.com">e-mail me</A> with your browser and version.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>Which browsers can display the table?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>All structure, font style, and size are shown completely in the 4.0 versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. Structure, but not font style or size is preserved in Navigator 3.0. Because of the way ROWSPAN and COLSPAN overlap to save markup, Internet Explorer 3.0 (and 4.0 for the Mac) do not display the periodic table correctly. Navigator 2.0 displays the table correctly, minus the cell background colors. Internet Explorer 2.0 does not support HTML tables. The table appears vastly distorted in Opera 3.5 but quite well in 3.6. To an extent, the information can even be extracted with Lynx.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>What editor was used to make the periodic table?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>Only notepad. No WYSIWYG or enhanced text editors were used.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>It could have been done in FrontPage, HotDog, or [insert WYSIWYG HTML editor here].</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>Probably not. But if it could, it would not be as cross-browser compatible as it is now and would take up at least twice the markup.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>What do you mean by &quot;complex tables&quot;?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>There are four qualities which make a table complex:</EM></DD>
     <DD>
      <UL>
       <LI><EM>The table uses many dependent columns and rows.</EM></LI>
       <LI><EM>The structure and markup cannot be optimized any further.</EM></LI>
       <LI><EM>COLSPAN and ROWSPAN are used extensively.</EM></LI>
       <LI><EM>Removing one cell will likely cause the table to collapse.</EM></LI>
      </UL>
     </DD>

     <DT><STRONG>But table XYZ is more complex.</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>If you find a table more complex, please <A HREF="mailto:michael@dayah.com">tell me about it</A>.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>What does it look like with table borders turned on?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM><A HREF="structure.html">See for yourself</A>.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>How many &lt;TABLE&gt;'s were used in the creation of the table?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>Structurally, only two tables were needed. For cosmetic reasons, there are sixteen tables total.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>How deep are the tables nested?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>Structurally, only one level of nesting was required. A second level was used for purely cosmetic reasons.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>Are there any images?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>No.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>The HTML looks proprietary.</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>One proprietary element was used to make the table look identical in both Navigator and Internet Explorer. This is the same reason the table does not validate using W3C's validator. The designer prioritizes usability over validation.</EM></DD>
     <DD><EM>If you would like to see what the periodic table looks like when no design &quot;tricks&quot; are used to make the table browser-compatible, <A HREF="html4css.html">look at the optimized version</A>. The optimized table is 12% smaller in file size than the browser-compatible version and is HTML 4 Strict DTD compliant. Though when it was made, no browser could render it correctly. The upcoming 5.0 browsers should render it identically to the browser-compatible table.</EM></DD>

     <DT><STRONG>Of which web technologies does the table take advantage?</STRONG></DT>
     <DD><EM>HTML 4.0, Cascading Style Sheets (level one and two), and JavaScript.</EM></DD>
