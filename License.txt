	I, Michael Dayah, the author of the Periodic Table of the Elements
page <http://www.benray.com/periodic>, hereby give Joe Barta permission to
use the table any way he sees fit at no cost as long as the table remains
intact. He may make minor modifications as necessary. Minor modifications
include adjusting relative links within the document, commenting the code,
and adding pointers to illustrate various concepts. The original author's
name will not be removed, neither will the link to e-mail him or the link
to his personal homepage. One link that must remain intact as-is is the
small counter image located within element 999. The reason being is so if
the page is stolen from Mr. Barta's site, I will be able to track down
where it went using the referrer logs. (I caught two different people
copying the page in its entirety using this method.) Mr. Barta may also
do a simple Find and Replace on the periodic table replacing "BORDER=0"
with "BORDER=1". This new document could be used to display the underlying
table structure.
