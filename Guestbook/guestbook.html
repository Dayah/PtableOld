<b>Gentlemen,

    Your element table ends too soon. There are other elements beyond your last ones of 103 and on. According to Bob Lazar, physicist and worker on the spacecraft buried under Area 51, he came across an element 115. I checked the peiodic table of Mark Winter, University of Sheffield, England, and his table contains elements up to 118. Why doesn't yours? Please let me know why there is a discrepancy. Mr. Lazar handled the element 115, and said there are 500 pounds of the element that is used to power the spacecraft. Please let me know about the missing element.

<b>Yeah, Michael, This is a cool periodic table.  It is the only one I found on the web showing the electronic structure of the elements.  I needed that to show one of my High School student pals the odd orbital filling of the transition metals - he was having a hard time understanding that.  It had been twenty years since I've thought about this stuff myself - I am a Bacteriologist.  Why are so many people having a hard time figuring out that if you click on the name of an element it links to a description of the element.  They sound like it is the first time they have been on line!  That what is causing the profanity of a few people.  Are they Jr. High kids or what?  Yea, you could put in more explainations and info.  But it served the purpose for me!  :) Thanks</b><br>

<b>I thought that your periodic table was great, I could look at it for ever.  I love elements.  OK now the real story, I think that you have no life and should be a bit more sociable like go out (maybe outside) and drink a few stubbies mate.  I know that it probably took you ages to do but I think that you would definetely have a better time if you were drunk.  You could have also made a better site if you were under alcoholic influence</b><br>
