  <p>Below you will find the answers to some commonly asked questions about the <a href="/periodic/">periodic table</A>. If you have a question that's not on this page or you would like to follow up on one of the below questions, <a href="feedback.html">contact me</a>.</p>

<!--
     <dt>Why does the page have a black background?</dt>
     <dd>You're visiting at night. If you'd rather it be white, come back tomorrow or stay up until dawn. a href="feedback.html"I don't like this./a</dd>
-->
     <dt>Where did the element names go?</dt>
     <dd>They are now turned off by default. Use the check boxes in the menu beneath the blue title to turn them on.</dd>

     <dt>New address?</dt>
     <dd>The old address, http://www.dayah.com/periodic/, will always work. It's worked for 9 years and will always redirect to the new address, ptable.com. The new domain is just to give you, the regular visitor, something easy to spell, type, and remember.</dd>

     <dt>Some of the blue and black lines look messed up or flicker.</dt>
     <dd>As of May 2007, this table now uses the "new" collapsed border model in favor of the previous complex interweaved overlapping rows and columns. Bugs in your browser may produce rendering anomalies. Consider voting for the relevant bugs: 262709 (transparent borders appear black), 203686 (collapse code abandoned), <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:Border_collapse#Discussion:_No_compromise_on_corners" rel="nofollow">corner conflict resolution</a>.</dd>

     <dt>What makes this periodic table different?</dt>
<ul style="font-weight: normal;">
<li><strong>All HTML. No images. No Flash.</strong> This gives all the scalability and accessibility of a normal web page while looking as good as any image or Flash out there. Highlight and copy data, print, and resize to suit your vision, just like you would with any web page. Your browser's View, Text Size scales the table up or down as you prefer.
<li><strong>Instantly swap layouts.</strong> Use the check boxes at the top of the page to dynamically switch between <em>simple</em>, with <em>names</em>, with <em>electron configuration</em>, and <em>inline rare earth metals</em>. View as much or as little information as you'd like.
<li><strong>Realtime data view.</strong> Move your mouse over any element to instantly update a dozen properties as well as a detailed view of that element.
<li><strong>Instantly swap data.</strong> Only want to see one piece of data at a time, like electronegativity? Whatever you choose appears in place of atomic mass while symbol and atomic number stay visible. Or, maximize and select names and/or electron configs to accompany the dataset you choose.
<li><strong>Visualize trends.</strong> Does atomic radius go up or down by group? Select it and the color of all elements will change in proportion to their values.
<li><strong>Reliable source data.</strong> Unlike other sites, our data doesn't come from secondary sources like other web sites. When important values disagree with <a href="http://www.webelements.com/">WebElements</a>, which also uses primary sources, we discuss who might be wrong and why, perhaps even leaving our data mismatched so you get the chance to make your own analysis.
<li><strong>State of matter slider.</strong> In the Chemical Series view, drag the slider above the nonmetals and see the state of matter each element is in at that temperature.
<li><strong>Time machine.</strong> After selecting discovery year, use the slider to go back in time and display only the elements discovered by that year.
<li><strong>Data subsets.</strong> Once you've selected a dataset, the slider reveals related properties. Sliding after selecting radius, for example, reveals covalent, empirical, and calculated radii. All told, the slider exposes another 11 properties in addition to the 12 shown, not including the first 30 ionization energies, allowing efficiency functioning on multiple levels and in multiple dimensions.
<li><strong>Orbitals.</strong> Complete orbital readout for each element's ground state along with diagrams following Hund's rules.
<li><strong>Dozens of languages.</strong> Element names in dozens of languages, even Asian scripts.
<li><strong><img src="Images/wikipedia.png" alt="W" align="top">ikipedia integration.</strong> Click any element to pop up a window with its Wikipedia page&hellip;in any language!
<li><strong>Instant search.</strong> Can't seem to find an element? Type its name, symbol, or atomic number into the box below the alkalis and it will instantly be highlighted.
<li><strong><img src="Images/ajax.png" alt="Ajax" align="absbottom"> data retrieval.</strong> Detailed data is retrieved using Ajax only when you request it.
<li><strong>Never reloads.</strong> Whether you're changing layouts, visualizing data, boiling and freezing elements, searching, or browsing Wikipedia, the site will never interrupt your session by reloading, opening new windows, or resizing your window.
<li><strong>Printable.</strong> The navigation bar at the top offers links to PDFs in American and European paper sizes as well as a large image.
<li><strong><a href="discovery.xml" type="application/rss+xml">Latest new elements <img src="Images/feed-icon-14x14.png" style="border: 0; height: 14px; width: 14px;"></a></strong> The day a new element is discovered or synthesized, we'll have the details for you. We even keep up with new, more precise relative atomic masses as IUPAC publishes them.
<li><strong>Small and fast.</strong> Other tables, if interactive at all, use any number of prewritten JavaScript libraries, making their speed based in a world that is built on rules. Because of this, they can never be as strong or as fast as ours can be.
<li><strong>Keyboard accessible.</strong> Can't or don't want to use the mouse? Your keyboard's tab and arrow keys expose the full functionality of the site. Enter and Escape open and close the Wikipedia window, just like you'd expect. The up/down arrows also manipulate the slider when inside its input box.
</ul>

     <dt>When was it made?</dt>
     <dd>September 1997 as a piece of HTML artwork, not a reference. It was posted on the web October 1, 1997. Element descriptions were added later in December 1997. Descriptions were significantly upgraded in summer 2005 to use data from Wikipedia in compliance with its license. Interactivity was radically enhanced summer 2007.</dd>

     <dt>Can I buy a poster?</dt>
     <dd>We're currently looking into producing a <a href="periodic-table-poster.html">periodic table poster</a>. First, we'll need some feedback from you on what size, paper, and finish you'd like.</dd>

     <dt>Can I print it?</dt>
     <dd>Yes, but only for personal or classroom use. Contact me to discuss larger scale distribution. I'll most likely let you use it, but request a copy of whatever it's going into. One person wanted to put it on a cake. In that case I only asked for a photo of the cake, but if he lived closer&hellip;</dd>

     <dt><big style="color: red;">Will you do my homework?</big></dt>
     <dd>Only if you're a cute girl. Make sure to attach a picture when you <a href="mailto:michael@dayah.com" onClick="alert('Seriously, attach your picture to the e-mail and I\'ll do your homework.')">e-mail me</a>.</dd>

     <dt>Is there a license agreement I must follow?</dt>
     <dd>Because of the frequent piracy of the periodic table, you are not allowed to redistribute the table electronically in any fashion. That means don't save it and upload it to your own web site. Don't worry about my bandwidth; link directly to my images and PDFs if you desire. Of course, you are allowed to print the table out for your own, personal use. If you would like to print out many copies for a classroom, please tell me. So far, I haven't ask for anything more than a copy of whatever it is used in.</dd>

     <dt>Can I link to your periodic table?</dt>
     <dd>By all means, but only if you think mine is the best. Please don't place me in a slew of dozens of links to periodic tables. The web doesn't need any more lists of links. Just link to the one best periodic table, whichever you think that is.</dd>

     <dt>How can I get in touch with you?</dt>
     <dd>The easiest way to reach me is MSN Messenger (lucent). I'm also on AIM as <img src="http://big.oscar.aol.com/Looseint?on_url=http://www.aol.com/aim/gr/online.gif&off_url=http://www.aol.com/aim/gr/offline.gif" align="absmiddle"> <a href="aim:goim?screenname=Looseint&message=Hi.+I+was+looking+at+your+periodic+table.">Looseint</a>. My e-mail address is michael@dayah.com.</dd>
