<!--
   <dt>Why does the page have a black background?</dt>
   <dd>You're visiting at night. If you'd rather it be white, come back tomorrow or stay up until dawn. a href="feedback.html"I don't like this./a</dd>
-->
   <dt>Where did the element names go?</dt>
   <dd>The site will show you as much detail as it can without horizontal scrolling. Widen your browser window or push F11 to show more data, or alternatively use the check boxes in the menu beneath the blue title.</dd>

   <dt>New address?</dt>
   <dd>The old address, dayah.com/periodic, will always work. The new domain <strong>Ptable.com</strong> is just to give you, the regular visitor, something easy to spell, type, and remember. Please link to it instead, even though it temporarily redirects here.</dd>

   <dt>Group 12 aren't transition metals? &hellip; Isn't it supposed to be Lanthan<u>ide</u>, not Lanthan<u>oid</u>? &hellip; Metalloid isn't a class of elements?</dt>
   <dd>No, not <a href="http://www.iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract04/RB-prs310804/Chap3-3.04.pdf">according to IUPAC [PDF]</a> (IR-3.6, page 8).</dd>

   <dt>How can I use the site when I'm not online?</dt>
   <dd>The best solution at this point is just to load the site in your browser, click around the tabs to cache most of the data, and then activate the Work Offline feature of your browser before revisiting the site. Most of the site will continue to function without Internet connectivity.</dd>

   <dt>The site is buggier in my favorite browser than it is in Internet Explorer.</dt>
   <dd>While your favorite browser may have better standards support when simply counting tags and properties, the bugs it does contain are more unstable and harder or impossible to work around. I'm <a href="about:credits">doing my part to remedy this</a>, but if you prefer a prettier layout, visit the site with IE7. To encourage repair of the most serious bugs affecting the site, please vote for them: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=318704">318704 (borders randomly don't appear)</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=262709">262709 (transparent borders appear black)</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145503">145503 (writing-mode not supported)</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203686">203686 (collapse code abandoned)</a>, <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:Border_collapse#Discussion:_No_compromise_on_corners">corner conflict resolution discussion</a>.</dd>

<dt>All XHTML. No images. No Flash.</dt> <dd>This gives all the scalability and <b>accessibility of a normal web page</b> while looking as good as any image or Flash out there. Highlight and copy data, print, and resize to suit your vision, just like you would with any web page. Your browser's View, Text Size scales the table up or down as you choose. If you prefer Flash, check out <a href="http://chem.touchspin.com/">Brian Adams' table</a>.
<dt>Instantly swap layouts.</dt> <dd>Use the check boxes at the top of the page to <b>dynamically switch between</b> <em>simple</em>, with <em>names</em>, with <em>electron configuration</em>, and <em>inline rare earth metals</em>. View as much or as little information as you'd like or your screen allows.
<dt>Realtime data view.</dt> <dd>Select Properties and move your mouse over any element to <b>instantly update a dozen properties</b> as well as a detailed view of that element.
<dt>Instantly swap data.</dt> <dd>Only want to see one piece of data at a time, like electronegativity? Whatever you choose <b>appears in place of atomic mass</b> while symbol and atomic number stay visible. Or, maximize and select names and/or electron configs to accompany the dataset you choose.
<dt>Visualize trends.</dt> <dd>Does atomic radius go up or down by group? Select it and the <b>color of all elements will change in proportion</b> to their values.
<dt>Reliable source data.</dt> <dd>Our data doesn't come from secondary sources. When important values disagree with <a href="http://www.webelements.com/">WebElements</a>, which also uses primary sources, we discuss who might be wrong and why, perhaps even leaving our data mismatched so you get the chance to make your own analysis. Significant digits are preserved in readouts whenever space permits. Translations and foreign element names, however, should be considered no more reliable than Wikipedia.
<dt>State of matter slider.</dt> <dd><b>Drag the slider</b> above the nonmetals and see the state of matter each element is in at that temperature.
<dt>Time machine.</dt> <dd>After selecting discovery year in Properties, use the slider to
